## Welcome to NSRS 2019!
The Network Science Research Symposium is organized and led by graduate students affiliated with the [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/) at Northeastern University. It creates a platform to showcase a variety of projects done by young researchers in Network Science, to receive feedback and initiate future collaborations.

The 2nd annual NSRS features:
- **Research sessions** consisting of oral presentations and short flash talks.
- **Grant unwind** about how a grant proposal "unfoded". Attendees will hear a different kind of perspective behind all the work that goes into a grant proposal, which hopefully will lead to a discussion of how to initiate and promote an early-stage research project.
- **Professional-life panel** where faculty members in NetSI discuss a set of miscellaneous questions about professional life in academia/network science with young researchers. This panel is part of the NetSI _professional practices seminar series_.
- **Slideshow karaoke** with dauntless presenters telling stories from a slidedeck full of surprise :smirk:
- **Network trivia** for fun :tada:
